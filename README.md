## Hi, I'm BKDDFS (Bartek Dawid Flis) 👋
I have one year of experience in software development. On a daily basis, I develop a system that automates earning on the YouTube platform. I place great emphasis on the quality of my code, adhering to best practices such as writing automated tests and following SOLID principles.
